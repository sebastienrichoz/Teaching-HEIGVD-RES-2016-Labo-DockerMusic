	Source: This program is based on the Thermomether example of wasadigi github user
			https://github.com/SoftEng-HEIGVD/Teaching-Docker-UDP-sensors

	This program simulates a "data collection station", which joins a multicast
	group in order to receive sounds played by musicians.
	The sounds are transported in json payloads with the following format:

	 	{
	   		"uuid" : "aa7d8cb3-a15f-4f06-a0eb-b8feb6244a60",
	    	"sound" : "ti-ta-ti",
	    	"timestamp" : "789153154"
	    }

	Usage: to start the auditor, use the following command in a terminal
		node auditor.js
