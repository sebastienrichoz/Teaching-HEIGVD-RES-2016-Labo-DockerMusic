/*
	Source: This program is based on the Thermomether example of wasadigi github user
		https://github.com/SoftEng-HEIGVD/Teaching-Docker-UDP-sensors

	This program simulates a musician in an orhcestra, who plays a sound each second 
	depending his instrument and publishes it on a multicast group.
	Other programs can join the group and receive the sound.

	The sound is transported in json payloads with the following format:
	
	{
		"uuid" : "aa7d8cb3-a15f-4f06-a0eb-b8feb6244a60",
		"sound" : "ti-ta-ti",
		"timestamp" : "789153154"
	}

	Usage: 	to start a musician, type the following command in a terminal
	(of course, you can run several musicians in parallel and observe that all
	sounds are transmitted via the multicast group):
	
	node musician.js <instrument>
	
	where <instrument> can be one of the following :
   	- piano
	- trumpet
	- flute
	- violin
	- drum
